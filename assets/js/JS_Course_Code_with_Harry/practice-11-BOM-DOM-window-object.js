// DOM = Docment Object Model
// Document = The whole HTML page converted in to JS object and named document

// window is a global object. We may write window.console.log but due to global we write console.log
// console.log(window);
// console.log(document);
// document.body.style.background = "lightblue";

// BOM = Browser Object Model
// The BOM represents additional objects provided by the browser (host environment) for working with everything except the document
// The functions alert/confirm/prompt are also a part of BOM
// E.g:- location.href = "https://codewithharry.com"
